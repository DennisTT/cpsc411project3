<h1>CPSC 411 - Stage 1: Parsing</h1>
<p>In
this stage of the project we are grouping together the work described
in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of the book. The goal of this stage is to
produce (and test) a working parser for MiniJava. It accepts a single
source file as input and produces a parse tree.</p><h2>Tools</h2><p>The
book proposes two useful parsing tools: JavaCC and SableCC. We are
going to use JavaCC. The first thing you will want to do is install the
<a href="http://eclipse-javacc.sourceforge.net/">JavaCC Eclipse plugin</a>. This will make it easy for you to integrate the use of JavaCC into your development process.</p><p>Documentation on using JavaCC is <a href="https://javacc.dev.java.net/doc/docindex.html">here</a>.</p><h2>Project Setup</h2><p>The
zip file in which these instructions are contained is an archived copy
of an Eclipse project. To import this project into Eclipse do as
follows:</p><ol><li>Select "File &gt; Import" Menu.</li><li>Select "General &gt; Existing Projects into Workspace".</li><li>Select&nbsp;"Select Archive file" and Browse for this .zip file.</li><li>Select&nbsp;the project and click "Finish".</li></ol><p>As in assignment 2, the project is set up with a number of JUnit tests. The provided tests should be thought of&nbsp;as an <span style="font-weight: bold;">executable specification</span>. This means that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> you should not change any code in the test classes</span>.&nbsp;Otherwise
you are free to change any and all code in the project. We also
encourage you to create additional tests, to more thoroughly test your
solution.</p><p>Test classes,<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>who's
name contains the word "Internal" are an exception to the "don't change
the tests" rule. These tests are intended to test a chunk of
functionality that is "internal" to your solution. You may in fact
chose to change these tests. For example, in this project a file
Test2LexInternal tests your scanner. As such it is dependent on
specific choices of token names. However only the parser itself
actually depends on these implementation details, so you could choose
to change the names given to different token classes without breaking
the implicit contract the parser has with the rest of the code. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></p><p>The project has the
following layout:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">src</span>:
directory with all the project source code including the following packages.</li><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.test.parser:</span> JUnit tests for this phase of the project.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.test: </span>Contains some support code for the tests.</li></ul><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.ast</span>: AST classes already implemented for you.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.visitor: </span>contains a basic "Visitor" infrastructure for the AST classes, including a PrettyPrintVisitor. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.parser: </span>A package containing a MiniJavaParser class that is called by the test code.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.parser.jcc: </span>This
package is currently empty except for a readme file. The intention is
that you will place your .jj file here and keep all the files generated
by JavaCC confined to this package. Except for the stubs in
minijava.parser there will be no calls directly to the generated code.</li></ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">sample: </span>directory containing the sample MiniJava program that come with the textbook online material.</li><li>readme*.html: Readme files about the project.</li><li>files starting with a "." : various settings that tell
Eclipse how to compile and run the project.</li></ul>
<h2>How to get started</h2><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';"></span><p>Many classes in the starter code are heavily commented and provide explanation about the code, as well as some explanation
on what you are supposed to do and how. In particular, the following
are good places to start:</p>
<ul><li>The README file at the toplevel of the src directory.</li><li>The README file in the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.parser.jcc </span>package.</li><li>The comments in <span style="font-weight: bold;">MiniJavaParser.java</span> in the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.parser</span> package<span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span></li><li>The comments in the test files <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test2LexInternal.java</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test3Parse.java</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test4Parse.java</span>.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></li><li>You should also read Chapter 2,3 and 4 of the textbook.</li></ul><p>One
further note: although you are allowed to change all code&nbsp;except
for the tests, this does not mean that you actually have to change any
code at all! In fact, you can complete this assignment simply by
providing an appropriate <span style="font-weight: bold;">MiniJava.jj</span> file in <span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.parser.jcc&nbsp;</span>package.</p><h2>Handing In</h2>
<p>Only one of the team members should hand in for your team. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make sure you have filled in the names of each team member in the src/README.txt file</span>. </p><p>The name of this project stage for the electronic handin is <b>
project1</b>. Please use the <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/ugrad/facilities/windows/handin.shtml">handin
web-interface</a>.</p>
<p>You should handin the entire contents of your project's src
directory, excluding the test files&nbsp; which you were not supposed
to change. We have provided a <span style="font-weight:
bold;">build.xml</span> script in the src directory that packages up the
correct files in a .zip file. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Please use
this script</span>, it will ensure a uniform layout for all handed in
materials, which makes it easier for the TA mark efficiently.</p>
