<h1>CPSC 411 - Stage 3: Translation to IR</h1>
<p>In
this stage of the project we are doing the work described
in Chapters 6, 7 and 8 of the book. The goal of this stage is to
produce (and test) a Translator that transforms a typechecked AST into IR
code that is ready to be turned into Assembly code by the next
stage.&nbsp;</p><p>This transformation (from AST to "easy
to&nbsp;assemblify" IR) happens in several steps.</p><ol><li>Transform the
  AST into a kind of "free form" IR.</li><li>Transform the "free form" IR
  into&nbsp;linearized IR.</li><li>Transform linearized IR into a list of
  basic blocks.</li><li>Do trace scheduling to optimize JUMPs and produce IR
  that has CJUMPS that are easy to generate code for.</li></ol><p>Step
1 is described in chapter 7 of the book. Steps 2, 3 and 4 are described
in Chapter 8. A complete implementation of Steps 2, 3 and 4 are
provided on the book's website. In the same spirit, this project drop
contains working implementations of these steps. That leaves Step 1 for
you to implement.</p><h2>Project Setup</h2><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Warning:</span>
Before installing the new files, it is advisable to make a backup copy of
your project. Otherwise you run the risk of overwriting any
changes you have made to some of the files that were provided in phases
1 and 2.</p><p>The
zip file in which these instructions are contained is an archived copy
of an Eclipse project. To import this project into Eclipse do as
follows:</p><ol><li>Select "File &gt; Import" Menu.</li><li>Select "General &gt; Existing Projects into Workspace".</li><li>Select&nbsp;"Select Archive file" and Browse for this .zip file.</li><li>Select&nbsp;the project and click "Finish".</li></ol><p>The project is set up with a number of JUnit tests. The provided tests should be thought of&nbsp;as an <span style="font-weight: bold;">executable specification</span>. This means that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> you should not change any code in the test classes</span>.&nbsp;Otherwise
you are free to change any and all code in the project. We also
encourage you to create additional tests, to more thoroughly test your
solution.</p><p>Test classes<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>whose
name contains the word "Internal" are an exception to the "don't change
the tests" rule. These tests are intended to test a chunk of
functionality that is "internal" to your solution.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></p><p>The project contains the same files from the phase 2 starter and the following new files:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">src&nbsp;</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.util: </span>The
class List provides a versatile implementation of lists that works
either as linked or array style list. This is used to represent various
lists of IR code.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.test.translate:</span> JUnit tests for this phase of the project.</li><ul><li>TestX86Frame and TestTranslate: your job :-)</li><li>The other tests: should pass if TestTranslate passes (unless the provided code in the canon package is broken)</li></ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.ir:</span> contains several subpackages related to manipulating / representing IR trees.</li><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">frame: </span>corresponds to the Frame package from the book.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">frame.x86:&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;this
is where you should implement X86 specific version of stuff in the frame
package (as described in Chapter 6 of the book).</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">temp:</span> representation of Temps and Labels.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">tree:</span> representation of IR trees.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">canon:</span> Chapter 8 algorithms to massage IR into a manageable form.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">interp:</span> Contains code implementing an IR interpreter, used to simulate execution of IR (so we can test whether the generated IR works).</li></ul></ul><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.translate:</span> Some starter code provided for you.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.translate.implementation:&nbsp;</span>
You should create this package. The intention is to put (as much as it
is possible / reasonable) all the code implementing the translator in this package.</li></ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">sample: </span>a
.out file containing the expected output for each sample program has
been added. (This is used by the unit tests to check the actual output).</li></ul><h2>Inheritance</h2><p>The
implementation of inheritance in MiniJava is optional. We may come back
to this later if we have time to cover the material from Chapter 14 of
the textbook. You may attempt to implement inheritance support if you like an extra challenge.</p><ul><ul><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';"></span></ul></ul>
<h2>How to get started</h2><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';"></span><p>I suggest you work as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fill in your names in the README_stage3 file at the toplevel of the src directory.</li><li>Read Chapter 6 of the book and implement your X86Frame class (some tests are in TestX86Frame.java).</li><li>Then read Chapter 7 of the book and work on passing TestTranslate.</li><li>Once
TestTranslate passes, the other tests should also pass, since you have
been provided with working implementations of the Chapter 8 algorithms
in <span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.ir.canon</span> package<span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span></li><li>The classes in <span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.ir.canon </span>implement
the algorithms from Chapter 8. Though you can probably finish the
assignment without understanding these, you will be expected to know
these algorithms for the final exam. If you want to really understand
how these work, a good exercise is to reimplement them from scratch by
yourself. This is however entirely optional. (Since I have not actually
gotten round to "OO-iffying" the Canon.java code yet, working on a
clean implementation of this one in particular would be very useful :-)</li></ul><p>One
further note: although you are allowed to change all code&nbsp;except
for the tests, this does not mean that you actually have to change any
code at all! In fact, you can complete this assignment by only adding code in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.translator.implementation</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.ir.frame.x86</span> packages.</p><h2>Handing In</h2>
<p>Only one of the team members should hand in for your team. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make sure you have filled in the names of each team member in the src/README_stage3.txt file</span>. </p><p>The name of this project stage for the electronic handin is <b>
project3</b>. Please use the <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/ugrad/facilities/windows/handin.shtml">handin
web-interface</a>.</p>
<p>You should handin the entire contents of your project's src
directory, excluding the test files. We have provided a <span style="font-weight: bold;">build.xml</span> script in the src directory that packages up the correct files in a .zip file. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Please use this script</span>, it will ensure a uniform layout for all handed in materials, which makes it easier for the TA.</p></body></html>
