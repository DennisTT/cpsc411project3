This directory contains the generated parser. The only file in here that
is not generated should be the MiniJavaParser.jj file.

The other files are generated by JavaCC. If you have installed the JavaCC 
plugin then the generated code will automatically be updated each time
you edit MiniJavaParser.jj.

This directory is initially empty. However, you can easily create a starting 
template file using the JavaCC Eclipse plugin. Refer to its documentation for
detailed instructions:
